## Dragon Behavior

<details>
<summary>Training</summary>
Almost every dragon can be trained, but it is different for every dragon.
<br> 
<br> 
Most dragons can be tamed by feeding them cod or salmon, but there are exceptions. 
<br> 
- Boulder Class dragons can be tamed with a variety of rocks, instead of fish. However, the type of rock depends on the dragon.
<br> 
- Some dragons eat different foods based on where they live. 
<br> 
<br> 
Check the Book of Dragons if you are unsure of how to train a specific dragon.
 
</details>
<details>
<summary>Riding</summary>
Most tameable dragons can be ridden and flown
<br> 
<br> 
To mount a dragon, interact with it.
<br> 
<br> 
When on a dragon, you can hold down the jump button to travel up and let go to travel down.
<br> 
Use your normal movement controls to move other directions.
<br> 
<br> 
While riding a dragon, you can make it breathe fire. There is a 10 second cooldown between shots
<br> 
- On touch controls, tap the circle in front of you when it turns green to shoot fire in the direction you are looking
<br> 
- On keyboard/mouse or console controller, attack to shoot fire in the direction you are looking
<br> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Sitting</summary>
Every tameable dragon can sit. When sitting, a dragon will not follow you.
<br> 
<br> 
To make a dragon sit, you must be crouching/sneaking. You then interact with them, as if you were going to ride them.
<br> 
The dragon will play a sitting animation, and will be unable to move, whether under its own control or yours.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Breeding</summary>
Every tameable dragon (except the night fury for now) can breed as an adult.
<br> 
<br> 
To make a dragon breed, you must have two trained adult dragons of the same type. Feed them the same food you would train them with. They will then breed, and lay an egg. 
<br> 
<br>
When the egg hatches, an untrained baby dragon will appear. Train it, and then wait for it to grow up, or feed it more food to make it grow up faster!
