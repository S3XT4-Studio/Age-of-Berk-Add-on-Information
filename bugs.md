Age of Berk has had countless hours of work put into it, but some bugs still slip through. **After verfiying that it is not a known bug** (check below), **please report bugs at [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wi3go3pZFQaGHhHvkKgHEykInerdWlRazn41bpYdGGI/edit#responses)** so that we can make the add-on better for everyone.

**The following bugs are known. Please do not make reports about them, as it will clog up our system and make it more difficult to find unknown bugs.**
- Dragon Hunters do not play a shooting animation.
- Most Dragons do not pathfind. Instead, they remain in the same general area.
- Dragon Cages rarely generate in the side of a Dragon Hunter ship, leading to the Dragon suffocating.
- Monstrous Nightmares do not play a sitting animation
