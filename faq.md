<summary>How do I update Age of Berk?</summary>
<br> 
Updating an add-on can cause some problems when done incorrectly, so please follow these steps:
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Make a Backup of Your World</b>
<br> 
- This can prevent loss of progress if you do something wrong.
<br> 
- There is an easy way to make a backup within Minecraft. Simply scroll to the bottom of that world's settings and click the "Copy World" button.
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Remove the Old Version</b>
<br> 
- Remove both the behavior pack and resource pack from the world. <b>Do not open the world until you re-add the add-on</b>
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Add the New Version</b>
<br> 
- Add the behavior pack and resource pack with the latest version of Age of Berk to the world.
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Open the World and Test</b>
<br> 
- Re-open the world
<br> 
- Check that new features are available and that you haven't lost any progress before calling the updating process a success.

<summary>What does the versioning system mean?</summary>
<br> 
Age of Berk uses a modified form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning">semantic versioning</a>, and is approaching v2.0.
<br> 
<br> 
Unlike normal semantic versioning, we are using versions starting at 1.5 and until 2.0 as development versions of v2.0. This means that those versions could potentially present more bugs than other versions, though we are working to avoid that.
<br> 
<br> 
Worlds that have previously used one version can not use a lower version without possible danger to your world. Downgrading this add-on is not supported.
<br> 
<br> 
Bug reports are only accepted for the latest version. Please double check that the bug occurs in the latest version before submitting a <a href="https://s3xt4-studio.github.io/Age-of-Berk-Add-on-Information/bugs">bug report</a>.
