I am one of the programmers on the team. I've loved the How to Train Your Dragon movies for over a decade. I cherish the opportunity to be a part of the development of this add-on.

I model, texture, and animate for the team. Iâ€™ve loved How to Train Your Dragon and Minecraft since I was a kid, and I always wished to find a way to bring the two together. Now I'm finally able to and I'm so glad I can.
