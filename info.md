## Dragon Behavior

<details>
<summary>Training</summary>
Almost every dragon can be trained, but it is different for every dragon.
<br> 
<br> 
Most dragons can be tamed by feeding them cod or salmon, but there are exceptions. 
<br> 
- Boulder Class dragons can be tamed with a variety of rocks, instead of fish. However, the type of rock depends on the dragon.
<br> 
- Some dragons eat different foods based on where they live. 
<br> 
<br> 
Check the Book of Dragons if you are unsure of how to train a specific dragon.
 
</details>
<br> 
<details>
<summary>Riding</summary>
Most tameable dragons can be ridden and flown
<br> 
<br> 
To mount a dragon, interact with it.
<br> 
<br> 
When on a dragon, you can hold down the jump button to travel up and let go to travel down.
<br> 
Use your normal movement controls to move other directions.
<br> 
<br> 
While riding a dragon, you can make it breathe fire. There is a 10 second cooldown between shots
<br> 
- On touch controls, tap the circle in front of you when it turns green to shoot fire in the direction you are looking
<br> 
- On keyboard/mouse or console controller, attack to shoot fire in the direction you are looking
<br>

<br> 
<details>
<summary>Sitting</summary>
Every tameable dragon can sit. When sitting, a dragon will not follow you.
<br> 
<br> 
To make a dragon sit, you must be crouching/sneaking. You then interact with them, as if you were going to ride them.
<br> 
The dragon will play a sitting animation, and will be unable to move, whether under its own control or yours.
